        <p class="desc">This story begins in the late 19th century, telling us about two half-brothers, Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando.</p>
        <p class="desc">
            A heavy rain, a stormy night, and careless carriage driving turned into a tragedy in a young family. A man named Dario Brando, who happened to be at the scene of the accident, never distinguished by good manners and ideas about life, decided to rob the injured aristocrat. But, to his regret or happiness, the man was alive. Having thanked Dario for saving his life, Sir Joestar, like a true gentleman, promised not to remain in debt.
            Twelve years later, dying, Dario, through his son, who hated him, gave Joestar a letter asking him to shelter the young offspring. After the death of his father, Dio Brando went to the estate, where he instantly ruined relations with the only son of the owner of the house, Jonathan Joestar, nicknamed JoJo. Jojo tried hard to look like a decent gentleman, but he was not very successful, and with the appearance of Dio, his carefree life turned into a real nightmare.

           <p class="desc"> The vicissitudes of fate are unknown to us, but is the intersection of these two opposites accidental? What surprises await the young people?<br> And what is the role of the mysterious mask in this story?</p>
